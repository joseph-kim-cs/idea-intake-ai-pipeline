Alex Martinez,Data,watsonx.ai,"Following the acquisition of DataStax, we can position Astra DB as the primary vector store for enterprise RAG deployments instead of Milvus. Astra DB provides better scalability for unstructured document ingestion and native Cassandra-based performance. The idea is to build a pre-configured RAG accelerator template in IBM watsonx.ai that integrates Astra DB for hybrid search (dense + sparse) and reduces onboarding time for clients in regulated industries.",https://github.com/example-org/astra-rag-template,67,True,4
Priya Shah,Automation,watsonx.orchestrate,"Develop a no-code idea triage workflow in watsonx.orchestrate that automatically categorizes intake submissions by domain (Data, AI, Automation) using LLM classification. The workflow would route AI-related ideas to a watsonx.ai technical review queue and Automation ideas to a process engineering review board. This reduces manual review effort and provides structured scoring (feasibility, revenue impact, technical complexity).",https://github.com/example-org/idea-intake-automation,56,True,5
Daniel Kim,AI,watsonx.ai,Create a “Hybrid Retrieval Blueprint” offering that combines Astra DB vector search with structured Db2 data to enable enterprise-grade multi-modal RAG. The solution would allow clients to query structured financial data and unstructured policy documents in a single response. This could be packaged as a vertical solution for banking and insurance clients migrating legacy knowledge bases to AI-powered assistants.,https://github.com/example-org/hybrid-retrieval-blueprint,59,True,6
